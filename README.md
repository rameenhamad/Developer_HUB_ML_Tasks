## Task 1: Disease Prediction Using Patient Data
### Objective:
Learn basic ML workflows to predict diseases like diabetes or heart disease.
### Dataset:
Used the UCI Heart Disease dataset (CSV format).
### Preprocessing:
- Filled missing values using mean/median/mode.
- Normalized numerical features between 0 and 1.
- Converted categorical features into numerical values using Label Encoding.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Viewed dataset statistics using describe().
- Plotted a correlation heatmap to understand feature relationships.
### Model Training:
**Trained two models:** Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
### Evaluation:
Accuracy was used as the primary metric.
- **Logistic Regression accuracy:** 82.06%
- **Random Forest accuracy:** 84.78%

Random Forest performed better and was selected as the final model.
